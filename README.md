# Operant Conditioning Chamber
Operant conditioning is a classical paradigm used in experimental psychology in which animals learn to perform an action in order to achieve a reward. By using this paradigm, it is possible to extract learning curves and measure accurately reaction times.
Here we describe a fully 3D printable device that is able to perform operant conditioning on  freely moving mice, while performing real-time tracking of the animal position.

## Installation
To install the software Raspberry Pi just download or copy the code in a folder of the raspian SO.
The code requires a raspberry camera and an arduino connected
